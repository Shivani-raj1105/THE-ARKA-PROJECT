“To make smart farming accessible to every farmer, regardless of geography or income — using open innovation and clean energy.”
🌍The Problem
🌾 60% of India's agriculture is rain-fed and highly dependent on manual irrigation methods.

💧 Farmers overwater or underwater crops due to lack of real-time soil data.

⚡ Rural farms often lack reliable electricity, making tech adoption difficult.

💸 Wastage of water, electricity, and labor leads to low crop yield and increased operational costs.


💡 Our Solution: THE-ARKA-PROJECT
A smart, solar-powered irrigation system that uses real-time soil moisture and environmental data to automate irrigation—saving water, time, and energy.

🌞 Powered by the sun, 🌿 guided by smart sensors, and 💧 optimized for every drop.
